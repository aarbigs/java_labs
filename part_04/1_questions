Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
an ordered list of objects.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
String[] cats = new String[10]

3) What is a multidimensional array?
An array of two or more dimensions or an array of arrays.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
dog[9]

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
when you've gone outside of the size of the array.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
array[array.length-1]

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
2147483647

9) What is a bubble sort?
A sorting method that used repeated comparison to exchange adjacent elements in an array.

10) How does a bubble sort work?


11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
An irregular array can be used when you need a two-dimensional array that is sparsely populated.

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
for(int x : array){
sout(x)
}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
while (i < array.length-1){
    sout(array[i]);
    i++
    }

14) What is a queue?
A queue is a list in which elements can be accessed in first-in, first-out order only.

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
Put and get. Each put operation places a new element on the end of the queue and each get operation retrieves the next
element from the front of the queue.

16) What is a stack?
A stack is a list in which elements can be accessed first-in, last-out order.

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
The order in which the items are pulled from the array.

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
When you want to iterate through every item in an array by an increment of one.

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?


20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
int t, i;
int table[][] = new int[2][3];
for (t = 0; t < 2; t++){
    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){
    }
}


21) What is a String?
A data type object which is a list of characters.

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
boolean equals(str), int length(), char charAt(index), int compareTo(str), int indexOf(str), int lastIndexOf(str)

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
they cannot be changed once created.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
javac Example.java
java Example 1 2
